                    Howdy!...again. My name is Jeremy Basso and I am a Sophomore Computer
                    Science major at <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html" target="_blank">Texas A&M</a>. Two years, four semesters, and three hackathons
                    into my education and it's safe to say that I am living the dream. With
                    each subject in computer science that I explore, I continue to find myself
                    chasing knowledge down the rabbit hole that is the ever expanding and
                    seemingly infinite domain which is Computer Science. From web development
                    to machine learning, there is yet to be a field in which I don't find fascinating.
                    I hope that by the end of my education here at A&M I've been able to reach
                    each and every corner of this computer generated world and come out ready 
                    to take on, create, and innovate new ones.

                        AlphaStar is a machine learning program created by the UK based company
                        DeepmindAI. As an avid gamer in highschool, I first found this project while
                        playing the real-time strategy game Starcraft 2. Starcraft 2, a competitive
                        resource 
                        collecting, military strategy game is all about making split-second
                        decisions with limited and/or imcomplete information. This provided the
                        perfect enviornment in which to train an AI as the program was forced to
                        make decisions with limited and/or incomplete information.This concept is applicable
                        in real world scenarios as you rarely have all the facts when making decisions.
                        It was this first exposure to a field in computer science that initially piqued my interest
                        into the subject and I still keep up with the project today. DeepMindAI today has been aquired
                        by Google and continues to work on AlphaStar and other machine learning projects
                        mainly centered around neuroscience research and other medical related fields.
                        While I live an ocean away from DeepMindAI, it is a goal of mine to work
                        with DeepMindAI in the future.
